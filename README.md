# LinkedListChallenge-Songs-PlayList

Create a program that implements a playlist for songs

- Create a Song class having Title and Duration for a song.
- The program will have an Album class containing a list of songs.
- The albums will be stored in an ArrayList.
- Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist (LinkedList) and will appear in the list in the order
they are added.

- Once the songs have been added to the playlist, create a menu of options to:
Quit, Skip forward to the next song, skip backwards to a previous song, replay the current song, list the songs in the playlist.

- A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist (so you can only play songs that
you own).
- As an optional extra, provide an option to remove the current song from the playlist.
